# City-EMS-System

This repo is a homework assignment completed for my Algorithms Course at Yeshiva University.
Attached you will find a PDF containing the instructions provided by the professor as well as my code and project.


The project is a simulator that builds a graph of a city which is hit by a natural disaster. The simulation dispatches emergency response units to 911 calls, accounting for severity of the injuries as well as obstructed roads due to the disaster.
